Human Contact Prediction
========================

General Description: 
This project is an implementation for predicting human contacts in Python. It has the implementations for several unsupervised contact predictors to infer missing contacts in a mobile social setting by exploiting the known properties of contact graphs. A contact graph is a graph in which nodes are people and edges represent people physical contacts.

Code Input: 
It uses the Infocom 2005 and 2006 human mobility traces collected by iMotes.

Code Output: 
It outputs the accuracies of different contact predictors.

Project Goal: 
The main goal was to predict who is the next person whom you will visit.

Implementation period: 
July - August 2010.
